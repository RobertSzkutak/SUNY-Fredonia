About:

I attend college at the State University of New York at Fredonia. This git repository is used to hold all of my assignments
and their solutions which I complete and submit electronically. 

License:

All files marked as being created by Robert L Szkutak II are licensed under the GPL v2. Files not marked as such are 
distributed as-is under no license or copyright or their original indicated license or copyright.

Miscellaneous:

The files here are a wide range from essays to coding projects. All solutions here have not been altered since being 
submitted to staff at SUNY Fredonia. Assignments and my solutions are pushed only after a semester is completed in order 
to avoid the potential for peers to copy my work during the semester.
