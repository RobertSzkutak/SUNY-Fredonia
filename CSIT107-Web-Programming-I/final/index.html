						<h1>About</h1>
						<p>Project CASSI is a SUNY Fredonia Computer Science Department Research project which aims to create an artifical intelligence agent to imrpove classroom education. CASSI works by data mining information about student behavior and making recommendations to improve the relationships between students. In it's current phase, CASSI is capable of identifying the best and most troubling relationships in a classroom. CASSI is also currently capable of finding the best possible seating arrangement for any classroom of students.</p>

						<p>Project CASSI was created in order to give modern classrooms the tools to evaluate and assist students as well as possible. The long term goal is to create an easy to use web interface that allows teachers to quickly and effortlessly gain quality advice with just a ew clicks.</p>
