            The Bike the Mountains Tour rises from the town of Littleton, 
            Colorado and explores the Colorado Front Range. Our tour 
            crosses the Continental Divide twice, giving you the 
            opportunity to bike the highest paved roads in the 
            United States. This tour is a classic showcase of Colorado's 
            Rocky Mountain scenery.
         </p>

         <p>Not designed for the weekend cyclist, this tour is offered

            also part of the registration fee.
            We guarantee tough climbs, amazing sights, sweaty jerseys, 
            and lots of fun.
         </p>
         <p>This is the seventh year we've offered the Bike the Mountains 
            Tour. It is our most popular tour and riders are returning 
            again and again. Our experienced tour leaders will be there 
            to guide, help, encourage, draft, and lead you
            every stroke of the way. Come join us!

         <p>We start from the foothills above Littleton, Colorado, 
            promptly at 9am. The first day is a chance to get

            what's to come.
         </p>

         <h2>Day 2</h2>
         <p>Day 2 starts with a climb up Bear Creek Canyon to Lookout
