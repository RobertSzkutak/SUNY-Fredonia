            <p>The Grand Junction Neonatal Intensive Care Unit offers comprehensive neonatal 
               diagnostic and treatment facilities for critically ill newborns. We're dedicated 
               to providing the highest quality care for all newborns, ranging from healthy 
               neonates to sick or premature newborns requiring close observation or intensive care.
            </p>
            <p>All of the neonatologists are board certified. We believe it's critical that our 
               clinicians learn about the latest advances in neonatal intensive care to
               better serve the community of Grand Junction.

            <h2>&mdash; Alisha Smith</h2>
         </hgroup>

         <p>While riding 100 miles in a day may sound extreme, most casual cyclists can complete 
            a century if they follow a comprehensive training routine. Your bike should be comfortable
            and fit you well. Consider having a tune-up before the ride, and carry a spare tire 
            and patch kit, tools, and a pump.
         </p>
         <p>If you're not a regular cyclist, start your training at least 12 weeks before your
            century. Hills are a great way to train for your ride, and don't forget to allow
            for recovery days after your longer rides.
         </p>
         <p>A few days prior to the ride, you should keep hydrated and cut back on caffeine and
            alcohol. On the day of your century, eat a light breakfast of high-carbohydrate foods 
            and drink lots of water. On the ride, drink water or a sports drink <em>before</em>
            you're thirsty.
         </p>
         <p>A century isn't a race, so adopt a relaxed pace that you can follow for several
            hours. Alter your position throughout your ride, getting up off the saddle,
            stretching your back, and moving your hand position. The ride goes easier if 
            you share it with a friend or two.
         </p>
         <p>Above all, <em>enjoy the ride</em>! Most centuries are designed to go through
            scenic areas of the state. Peddle on and remember to watch the scenery.
         </p>
