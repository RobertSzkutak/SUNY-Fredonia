            <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
            <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was 
            born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
            mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
            and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
            prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and 
            papers.</em> His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>
            <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
            work, <cite>Introductio in analysin 
            infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
            well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
            <cite>Lettres &agrave une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), giving a clear 
            non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
            time.</p>
            <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
            Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi, were introduced 
            in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
            a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
            of mathematics.</p>

            <h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>
            <p>Euler's Equation</p>
            <p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var> (<var><sup>ix</sup></var>)</p>
            <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
            and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
            the identity</p>
            <p><var>e</var>(<sup>&Pi;<var>i</var></sup>) + 1 = 0</p>
            <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &Pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
            a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
            conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
            Euler's Identity as the 
            most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
